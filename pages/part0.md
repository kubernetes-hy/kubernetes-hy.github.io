## General ##

### Prerequisites ###

Attendees are expected to have completed [DevOps with Docker](https://devopswithdocker.com) or have experience with Docker and docker-compose.
In addition experience with web software is required, such as [Full Stack Web Development](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) or equivalent.
To complete the exercises and examples in material attendees are required to have computers with admin/superuser priviledges.

### Course material ###

The course material is meant to be read part by part from start to finish. To get a passing grade you have to do every exercise. There are exercises in the material placed so that you will have learned needed skills in the material before it. You should do the exercises as you go through the material. However, note that as we progress further into the course the exercises will require more googling and you should supplement your knowledge with official documentation!

The course material is written for Mac, so some instructions may lack platform specific details. Please make a pull request to the course material in case you find any mistakes or wish to add something. You can also add an "issue" through GitHub in case you find any issues with the course material. @jakousa in the telegram group also works in some quick-fix cases.

## Completing course ##

To complete the course you will need to do and submit all exercises in parts 1-5. There is no exam.

The total workload of the course _has not been estimated yet_. We can estimate how long it took others by peeking at the [statistics](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/kubernetes2020).

### Exercises ###

All exercises need to be completed for grading.

Make a repository to github and publish your solutions there in clearly ordered files / folders. If you need help publishing using git you should refer to their [guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). Make sure that the repository is available to me, either by using a public repository or a private repository and adding [Jakousa](https://github.com/Jakousa) as a collaborator.

Most of the exercises will require you to write code and / or publish something to docker hub.

When you have completed a part, use the submission application to mark your exercises. You can not edit a submission so make sure you have completed enough exercises for a part before submitting.

There are multiple exercises in each part. After you've completed all of the exercises for a part, use the [submission application](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/kubernetes2020). Note that you can **not** edit a submission so mark all exercises as completed.

### Grading ###

Course size is 5 ECTS credits. Pass/Fail grading, simply complete all exercises.

## Google Cloud Credits ##

In part 3 we'll use Google Kubernetes Engine. It's not free. 

Google has offered students with @helsinki.fi email addresses some Google Cloud Credits and everyone starting with Google Cloud has $300 worth of free credits.

Finnish/Open University students, you will be given a @helsinki.fi address when you register to an Open University course, this will be a task for you at the end of part 2.

If you are not eligible for a @helsinki.fi email address and you have used all $300 credits there is nothing I can do. You can complete parts 1-2 and most likely 4-5, but part 3 is required for course completion and the certificate. For the eligibility for credits check the list and link at the bottom of [registration page](/registration).
