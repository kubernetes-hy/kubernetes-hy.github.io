This course is an introductory course to Kubernetes with K3s and GKE. In this course, you will develop software with a microservice architecture that utilizes Kubernetes to serve software that scales and deploys automatically. And learn how to manage it all.

**This course can not be completed with the faculty computers.** Attendees need to provide their own computers
with admin / superuser priviledges.

Course details and starting instructions can be found in [part 0](/part-0).

Registration is only required for ECTS credits. The certificate does not require registration or separate sign up. For ECTS credits (Finnish / Open Universitstudents) the registration is after you've completed part 2 and there will be a link at the end of the part.
