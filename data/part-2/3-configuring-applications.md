Kubernetes has two resources for configuration management. [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) are for sensitive information that are given to containers on runtime. [ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) are quite much like secrets but they may contain any kind of configurations. Use cases for ConfigMaps vary: you may have a ConfigMap mapped to a file with some values that the server reads during runtime. Changing the ConfigMap will instantly change the behavior of the application. Both can be used to introduce environment variables.

### Secrets

Let's use [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) to display images on a simple web app. Authentication to the API is done with an API key. According to the [API docs]( https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) we just need to log in to get ourselves a key.

The app manifests are [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/tree/master/app4/manifests). Let us start up the app with a service and an ingress:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/master/app4/manifests/deployment.yaml \
                -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/master/app4/manifests/ingress.yaml \
                -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/master/app4/manifests/service.yaml
```

The application requires an API_KEY environment variable with a valid API key as the value.

The env is defined as a [secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) in the deployment as follows:

**deployment.yaml**

```yaml
# ...
containers:
  - name: imageagain
    envFrom:
      - secretRef:
          name: pixabay-apikey
```

This assumes that the secret _pixabay-apikey_ defines the key as a variable called *API_KEY*. If the env name in the secret would be different, the longer form of definition could be used in the deployment:

**deployment.yaml**

```yaml
# ...
containers:
  - name: imageagain
    env:
      - name: API_KEY # ENV name passed to container
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: pixabay-apikey
            key: API_KEY # ENV name in the secret
```

The application won't run at first and we can see:

```bash
$ kubectl get pod
NAME                            READY   STATUS                       RESTARTS       AGE
imageapi-dep-6cdd4879f7-zwlbr   0/1     CreateContainerConfigError   0              13m
```

The exact reason can be seen with the command `describe`:

```bash
$ kubectl describe pod imageapi-dep-6cdd4879f7-zwlbr
Name:             imageapi-dep-6cdd4879f7-zwlbr
Status:           Pending
IP:               10.42.0.89

...

Events:
  Type     Reason     Age     From       Message
  ----     ------     ----    ----       -------
  Warning  Failed     21m     kubelet    Error: secret "pixabay-apikey" not found

```

Let's use a secret to pass the API key environment variable to the application.

Secrets use [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoding to avoid having to deal with special characters. We would also like to use encryption to avoid printing our API_KEY for the world to see. At first, for the sake of testing, create and apply a new file secret.yaml with the following:

**secret.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pixabay-apikey
data:
  API_KEY: aHR0cDovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PWRRdzR3OVdnWGNR
  # base64 encoded value should look something like this, note that this won't work
```

The base64 encoded key can be created eg. with [this](https://www.base64encode.org/) online tool, or in console with the command `base64`:

```bash
$ echo -n 'my-string' | base64
bXktc3RyaW5n
```

As the containers are already instructed to use the environment from the secret, using it happens automatically. We can now confirm that the app is working at http://localhost:8081.

Since anyone can reverse the base64 version we can't save that to version control. Since we want to store our configuration into a long-term storage we'll need to encrypt the value.

There are multiple solutions for secret management depending on the platform. Cloud service providers may have their own solution, like Google Cloud [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) or [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/). For a Kubernetes native solution, we could use [SealedSecrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets). In fact, the SealedSecrets were used in a previous version of this course.

We will use [SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) to encrypt the secret yaml. The tool has some additional flexibility, so I hope you get some use out of it, regardless of the environment you will be working in the future. For example, you could use it with Docker compose files. Please take a moment to read through the Readme, or at least the [Motivation](https://github.com/mozilla/sops#motivation). We will use [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) for encryption because it's recommended over PGP in the Readme. So install both of the tools, SOPS and age.

Let's create a key-pair first:

```bash
$ age-keygen -o key.txt
  Public key: age17mgq9ygh23q0cr00mjn0dfn8msak0apdy0ymjv5k50qzy75zmfkqzjdam4
```

This key.txt file now contains our public and secret keys. The secret key still can not be added to version control, its our personal key. Let's encrypt the values in the file secret.yaml. You can also omit the --encrypted-regex if you want.

```bash
$ sops --encrypt \
       --age age17mgq9ygh23q0cr00mjn0dfn8msak0apdy0ymjv5k50qzy75zmfkqzjdam4 \
       --encrypted-regex '^(data)$' \
       secret.yaml > secret.enc.yaml
```

The secret.enc.yaml looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pixabay-apikey
data:
  API_KEY: ENC[AES256_GCM,data:geKXBLn4kZ9A2KHnFk4RCeRRnUZn0DjtyxPSAVCtHzoh8r6YsCUX3KiYmeuaYixHv3DRKHXTyjg=,iv:Lk290gWZnUGr8ygLGoKLaEJ3pzGBySyFJFG/AjwfkJI=,tag:BOSX7xJ/E07mXz9ZFLCT2Q==,type:str]

```

We can safely store the file to the version control, since only the holders of the secret key pair of `age17mgq9ygh23q0cr00mjn0dfn8msak0apdy0ymjv5k50qzy75zmfkqzjdam4` will be able to decode it. Remember to use your own keys!

If we want to encrypt a file for the whole team, we will need to add a list of public keys while encrypting. Any of the private key owners can then decrypt the file. In fact, the best method is that (almost) no-one has the private key! Public key can be used to encrypt individual files and the private key can be stored separately and used to decrypt the file just in time.

You can decrypt the encrypted file by exporting the key file in *SOPS\_AGE\_KEY\_FILE* environment variable and running sops with --decrypt flag.

```console
$ export SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=$(pwd)/key.txt

$ sops --decrypt secret.enc.yaml > secret.yaml
```

You can also apply a secret yaml via piping directly, this helps avoid creating a plain secret.yaml file:

```console
$ sops --decrypt secret.enc.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

<exercise name='Exercise 2.05: Secrets'>

In all future exercises if you are using an API key or a password, such as a database password, you will use Secrets. You can use `SOPS` to store it to a git repository. _Never_ save unencrypted files into a git repository.

There's nothing specific to submit, all following submissions should follow the rule above.

### ConfigMaps

[ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) are similar but the data doesn't have to be encoded and is not encrypted. Let's say you have a videogame server that takes a configuration file _serverconfig.txt_ which looks like this:

```ini
maxplayers=12
difficulty=2
```

We could use a ConfigMap to contain the file:

**configmap.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap
data:
  serverconfig.txt: |
    maxplayers=12
    difficulty=2
```

Now the ConfigMap can be added to the container as a volume. By changing a value, like "maxplayers" in this case, and applying the ConfigMap the changes would be reflected in that volume.

<exercise name='Exercise 2.06: Documentation and ConfigMaps'>

Use the official Kubernetes documentation for this exercise.
- [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) and
- [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/)

should contain everything you need.

Create a ConfigMap for the "Log output" application. The ConfigMap should define one file _information.txt_ and one env variable _MESSAGE_.

The app should map the file as a volume, and set the environment variable and print the content of those besides the usual output:


```plaintext
file content: this text is from file
env variable: MESSAGE=hello world
2024-03-30T12:15:17.705Z: 8523ecb1-c716-4cb6-a044-b9e83bb98e43.
Ping / Pongs: 3
```
