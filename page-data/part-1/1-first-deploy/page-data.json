The opposite of a microservice is a service that is self-contained and independent called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monolith</a>.</p><p>The misconception of microservices being a large number of extremely small services is proliferated by large enterprises. If you have an extremely large enterprise where teams don't even know the existence of other teams you may have an unconventionally large number of microservices. Due to the insanity of a large number of small services without any good reasoning we're witnessing the term monolith trending in 2020.</p><ul>\n<li>\"Monoliths are the future\" - Kelsey Hightower, Staff Developer Advocate at Google, <a href=\"https://changelog.com/posts/monoliths-are-the-future\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"Monoliths are the Future\"</a></li>\n</ul><p>For the context of this unpopular opinion, Kelsey Hightower points out at \"The problem people try to solve with microservices doesn't really line up with reality\", leading to <em>Distributed Monoliths</em> where you have a large number of microservices without a good reason.</p><ul>\n<li>\"Run a small team, not a tech behemoth? Embrace the monolith and make it majestic. You Deserve It!\" - David Heinemeier Hansson, cofounder &#x26; CTO at Basecamp, <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"The Majestic Monolith\"</a></li>\n</ul><p>And this evolves into <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith-can-become-the-citadel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"The Majestic Monolith can become The Citadel\"</a> with the following: \"next step is The Citadel, which keeps the Majestic Monolith at the center, but supports it with a set of Outposts, each extracting a small subset of application responsibilities.\"</p><p>When to use microservices? In the following video where Sam Newman and Martin Fowler discuss microservices, the answer is: \"When you've got a really good reason\".</p><p>It also includes the top 3 reasons for using microservices:</p><ul>\n<li>Zero-downtime independent deployability</li>\n<li>Isolation of data and of processing around that data</li>\n<li>Use microservices to reflect the organizational structure</li>\n</ul><p><strong>When To Use Microservices (And When Not To!)</strong></p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GBTdnfD6s5Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>A big topic in the video was also the <em>Distributed Monolith</em>, where the services are not independently deployable. This is possibly part of the reason why microservices are so hard to define. A simple definition such as \"A microservice is any service that is smaller than a monolith\", can be used to claim that a Distributed Monolith is a microservice. So a seemingly microservice architecture that does not have the benefits of a microservice architecture may actually be a disguised monolith.</p><p>Since it is so hard to define rather than going first into microservices we should listen to the first two takeaways from the video that are \"One should use microservices as a means to obtain a desired outcome rather than for the sake of using a new technology\" and \"Microservices shouldn't be the default option. If you think a service architecture could help, try it with one of the modules from a very simple monolith typology and let it evolve from there\".</p><p>However, sometimes during this course we'll do <strong>arbitrary</strong> splits to our services just to show the features of Kubernetes. So even though we are doing \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">microservices</a>\" in this course, a healthy amount of scepticism is required around microservices in the real world. We will see at least one actual and well-justified use case for microservices with service scaling during the course.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-kubernetes\" style=\"position:relative;\">What is Kubernetes?<a href=\"#what-is-kubernetes\" aria-label=\"what is kubernetes permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2><p>Let's say you have 3 processes and 2 computers incapable of running all 3 processes. How would you approach this problem?</p><p>You'll have to start by deciding which 2 processes go on the same computer and which 1 will be on the different one. How would you fit them? By having the ones demanding most resources and the least resources on the same machine or having the most demanding be on its own? Maybe you want to add one process and now you have to reorganize all of them. What happens when you have more than 2 computers and more than 3 processes? One of the processes is eating all of the memory and you need to get that away from the \"critical-bank-application\". Should we virtualize everything? Containers would solve that problem, right? Would you move the most important process to a new computer? Maybe some of the processes need to communicate with each other and now you have to deal with networking. What if one of the computers break? What about your Friday plans to visit the local Craft brewery?</p><p>What if you could just define \"This process should have 6 copies using X amount of resources.\" and have the 2..N computers working as a single entity to fulfill your request? That's just one thing Kubernetes makes possible.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In essence, Kubernetes is the sum of all the bash scripts and best practices that most system administrators would cobble together over time, presented as a single system behind a declarative set of APIs.</p>&mdash; Kelsey Hightower (@kelseyhightower) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1125440400355782657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 6, 2019</a></blockquote><p>Or more officially:</p><p>“Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

The fact that you can apply manifest from the internet just like that will come in handy.</p><p>Instead of deleting the deployment we could just apply a modified deployment on top of what we already have. Kubernetes will take care of rolling out a new version. By using tags (e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">dwk/image:tag</code>) with the deployments each time we update the image we can modify and apply the new deployment yaml. Previously you may have always used the 'latest' tag, or not thought about tags at all. From the tag Kubernetes will know that the image is a new one and pulls it.</p><p>When updating anything in Kubernetes the usage of delete is actually an anti-pattern and you should use it only as the last option. As long as you don't delete the resource Kubernetes will do a rolling update, ensuring minimum (or none) downtime for the application. On the topic of anti-patterns: you should also always avoid doing anything imperatively!
