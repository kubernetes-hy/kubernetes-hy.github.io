How would you approach this problem?</p><p>You'll have to start by deciding which 2 processes go on the same computer and which 1 will be on the different one. How would you fit them? By having the ones demanding the most resources and the least resources on the same machine or having the most demanding be on its own? Maybe you want to add one process and now you have to reorganize all of them. What happens when you have more than 2 computers and more than 3 processes? One of the processes is eating all of the memory and you need to get that away from the \"critical-bank-application\". Should we virtualize everything? Containers would solve that problem, right? Would you move the most important process to a new computer? Maybe some of the processes need to communicate with each other and now you have to deal with networking. What if one of the computers breaks? What about your Friday plans to visit the local Craft brewery?</p><p>What if you could just define \"This process should have 6 copies using X amount of resources.\" and have the 2..N computers working as a single entity to fulfill your request?

The port on our machine, above 50122, is randomly chosen. We could have opted out of the load balancer with <code class=\"language-text\">k3d cluster create -a 2 --no-lb</code> and the port would be open straight to the server node. Having a load balancer will offer us a few features we wouldn't otherwise have, so let's keep it in.</p><p>K3d helpfully also set up a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kubeconfig</a>, a file that is used to organize information about clusters, users, namespaces, and authentication mechanisms.

Kubectl is the Kubernetes command-line tool and will allow us to interact with the cluster. Kubectl will read kubeconfig from the location in KUBECONFIG environment value or by default from <code class=\"language-text\">~/.kube/config</code> and use the information to connect to the cluster.

During the course, you will develop your own application. The technologies used for the application do not matter - for the examples we're going to use <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Node.js</a> but the example application will be offered through GitHub as well as Docker Hub.</p><p>Let's launch an application that generates and outputs a hash every 5 seconds or so.</p><p>I have prepared one <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/tree/master/app1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, you can test it with <code class=\"language-text\">docker run jakousa/dwk-app1</code>.</p><p>To deploy an image, we need the cluster to have access to the image. By default, Kubernetes is intended to be used with a registry. We will use the familiar registry <em>Docker Hub</em>, which we also used in <a href=\"http://devopswithdocker.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DevOps with Docker</a>. If you've never used Docker Hub, it is the place where the Docker client defaults to. E.g. when you run <code class=\"language-text\">docker pull nginx</code>, the nginx image comes from Docker Hub. See the course <a href=\"https://devopswithdocker.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DevOps for Docker</a> for further details e.g. on pushing your images to Docker Hub if needed.</p><p>It is also possible to use local images with k3d, but that won't work with non-k3d solutions. If you want to try using local images, use <code class=\"language-text\">k3d image import &lt;image-name&gt;</code>. Then you must edit the deployment's <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#image-pull-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">imagePullPolicy</a> from the default <code class=\"language-text\">Always</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">IfNotPresent</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">Never</code> to allow the local image to be used. The deployment can be edited after creation with <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl edit deployment &lt;deployment-name&gt;</code>.</p><text-box name=\"Example applications\" variant=\"hint\">\nIn the future, the material will use the offered applications in the commands.

It is hard to imagine how someone in their right mind could be maintaining multiple applications like that. Thankfully we will now use a <em>declarative</em> approach where we define how things should be rather than how they should change. This is more sustainable in the long run than the imperative approach and will let us keep our sanity.</p><p>Before redoing the previous steps via the declarative approach, let's take the existing deployment down.</p><div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"console\"><pre class=\"language-console\"><code class=\"language-console\">$ kubectl delete deployment hashgenerator-dep\n  deployment.apps &quot;hashgenerator-dep&quot; deleted</code></pre></div><p>and create a new folder named <code class=\"language-text\">manifests</code> and place a file called deployment.yaml with the following contents (you can check the example <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/tree/master/app1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>) there:</p><p><strong>deployment.yaml</strong></p><div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"yaml\"><pre class=\"language-yaml\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span class=\"token key atrule\">apiVersion</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> apps/v1\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">kind</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> Deployment\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">metadata</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> hashgenerator<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>dep\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">spec</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">replicas</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">selector</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">matchLabels</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"token key atrule\">app</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> hashgenerator\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">template</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">metadata</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"token key atrule\">labels</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"token key atrule\">app</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> hashgenerator\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">spec</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"token key atrule\">containers</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> hashgenerator\n          <span class=\"token key atrule\">image</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> jakousa/dwk<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>app1<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>b7fc18de2376da80ff0cfc72cf581a9f94d10e64</code></pre></div><text-box name=\"Text editor of choice\" variant=\"hint\">\n  I personally use Visual studio code to create these yaml files. It has helpful autofill, definitions, and syntax checks for Kubernetes with the extension Kubernetes by Microsoft. Even now it helpfully warns us that we haven't defined resource limitations. I won't care about that warning yet, but you can figure it out if you want to.\n</text-box><p>This looks a lot like the docker-compose.yaml files we have previously written. Let's ignore what we don't know for now, which is mainly labels, and focus on the things that we know:</p><ul>\n<li>We're declaring what kind it is (kind: Deployment)</li>\n<li>We're declaring it a name as metadata (name: hashgenerator-dep)</li>\n<li>We're declaring that there should be one of them (replicas: 1)</li>\n<li>We're declaring that it has a container that is from a certain image with a name</li>\n</ul><p>Apply the deployment with <code class=\"language-text\">apply</code> command:</p><div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"console\"><pre class=\"language-console\"><code class=\"language-console\">$ kubectl apply -f manifests/deployment.yaml\n  deployment.apps/hashgenerator-dep created</code></pre></div><p>That's it, but for the sake of revision, let's delete it and create it again:</p><div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"console\"><pre class=\"language-console\"><code class=\"language-console\">$ kubectl delete -f manifests/deployment.yaml\n  deployment.apps &quot;hashgenerator-dep&quot; deleted\n\n$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/master/app1/manifests/deployment.yaml\n  deployment.apps/hashgenerator-dep created</code></pre></div><p>Woah! The fact that you can apply manifest from the internet just like that will come in handy.</p><p>Instead of deleting the deployment, we could just apply a modified deployment on top of what we already have. Kubernetes will take care of rolling out a new version. By using tags (e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">dwk/image:tag</code>) in the deployments, each time we update the image we can modify and apply the new deployment yaml. Previously you may have always used the 'latest' tag, or not thought about tags at all. From the tag Kubernetes will know that the image is a new one and pulls it.</p><p>When updating anything in Kubernetes the usage of delete is actually an anti-pattern and you should use it only as the last option. As long as you don't delete the resource Kubernetes will do a rolling update, ensuring minimum (or none) downtime for the application. On the topic of anti-patterns: you should also always avoid doing anything imperatively! If your files don't tell Kubernetes and your team what the state should be and instead you run commands that edit the state you are just lowering the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bus factor</a> for your cluster and application.</p><exercise name='Exercise 1.03: Declarative approach'><p>In your \"Log output\" application create a folder for manifests and move your deployment into a declarative file.</p><p>Make sure everything still works by restarting and following logs.</p></exercise><exercise name='Exercise 1.04: Project v0.2'><p>Create a deployment.yaml for the project.</p><p>You won't have access to the port yet but that'll come soon.</p></exercise><p>Note applying a new deployment won't update the application unless the tag is updated.
