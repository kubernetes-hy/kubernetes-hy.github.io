Here are the preliminary tools to solve problems.</p><p>The first is <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl describe</code> which can tell you most of everything you need to know about any resource.</p><p>The second is <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl logs</code> with which you can follow the logs of your possibly broken software.</p><p>The third is <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl delete</code> which will simply delete the resource and in some cases, like with pods in deployment, a new one will be automatically released.</p><p>Finally, we have the overarching tool <a href=\"https://k8slens.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lens \"The Kubernetes IDE\"</a>. Which you should start using right now to familiarize yourself with the usage.</p><p>During exercises you also have our Discord channel available (which you joined in <a href=\"/part-0\">part 0</a>).</p><p>Let's test these tools and experiment using Lens. You will likely face a real debugging challenge during the exercises and there is another preplanned one in part 5 when we have a larger set of moving parts available to us.</p><p>Let's deploy the application and see what's going on.</p><div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"console\"><pre class=\"language-console\"><code class=\"language-console\">$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/master/app1/manifests/deployment.yaml\n  deployment.apps/hashgenerator-dep created\n\n$ kubectl describe deployment hashgenerator-dep\n  Name:                   hashgenerator-dep\n  Namespace:              default\n  CreationTimestamp:      Wed, 16 Sep 2020 16:17:39 +0300\n  Labels:                 &lt;none&gt;\n  Annotations:            deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: 1\n  Selector:               app=hashgenerator\n  Replicas:               1 desired | 1 updated | 1 total | 1 available | 0 unavailable\n  StrategyType:           RollingUpdate\n  MinReadySeconds:        0\n  RollingUpdateStrategy:  25% max unavailable, 25% max surge\n  Pod Template:\n    Labels:  app=hashgenerator\n    Containers:\n     hashgenerator:\n      Image:        jakousa/dwk-app1:b7fc18de2376da80ff0cfc72cf581a9f94d10e64\n      Port:         &lt;none&gt;\n      Host Port:    &lt;none&gt;\n      Environment:  &lt;none&gt;\n      Mounts:       &lt;none&gt;\n    Volumes:        &lt;none&gt;\n  Conditions:\n    Type           Status  Reason\n    ----           ------  ------\n    Available      True    MinimumReplicasAvailable\n    Progressing    True    NewReplicaSetAvailable\n  OldReplicaSets:  &lt;none&gt;\n  NewReplicaSet:   hashgenerator-dep-75bdcc94c (1/1 replicas created)\n  Events:\n    Type    Reason             Age    From                   Message\n    ----    ------             ----   ----                   -------\n    Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  8m39s  deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set hashgenerator-dep-75bdcc94c to 1</code></pre></div><p>There's a lot of information we are not ready to evaluate yet.

The events are often the place to look for errors.</p><p>The command <code class=\"language-text\">describe</code> can be used for other resources as well. Let's see the pod next:</p><div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"console\"><pre class=\"language-console\"><code class=\"language-console\">$ kubectl describe pod hashgenerator-dep-75bdcc94c-whwsm\n  ...\n  Events:\n    Type    Reason     Age   From                              Message\n    ----    ------     ----  ----                              -------\n    Normal  Scheduled  15m   default-scheduler                 Successfully assigned default/hashgenerator-dep-75bdcc94c-whwsm to k3d-k3s-default-agent-0\n    Normal  Pulling    15m   kubelet, k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  Pulling image &quot;jakousa/dwk-app1:b7fc18de2376da80ff0cfc72cf581a9f94d10e64&quot;\n    Normal  Pulled     15m   kubelet, k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  Successfully pulled image &quot;jakousa/dwk-app1:b7fc18de2376da80ff0cfc72cf581a9f94d10e64&quot;\n    Normal  Created    15m   kubelet, k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  Created container hashgenerator\n    Normal  Started    15m   kubelet, k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  Started container hashgenerator</code></pre></div><p>There's again a lot of information but let's focus on the events this time. Here we can see everything that happened. Scheduler put the pod to the node with the name \"k3d-k3s-default-agent-0\" successfully pulled the image and started the container. Everything is working as intended, excellent. The application is running.</p><p>Next, let's check that the application is actually doing what it should by reading the logs.</p><div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"console\"><pre class=\"language-console\"><code class=\"language-console\">$ kubectl logs hashgenerator-dep-75bdcc94c-whwsm\n  jst944\n  3c2xas\n  s6ufaj\n  cq7ka6</code></pre></div><p>Everything seems to be in order. However, wouldn't it be great if there was a dashboard to see everything going on? Let's see what the Lens can do.</p><p>First, you'll need to add the cluster to Lens. If the config is not available in the dropdown you can get the kubeconfig for custom with <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl config view --minify --raw</code>. After you've added the cluster open Workloads/Overview tab.
